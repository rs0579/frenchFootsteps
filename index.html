            <p class="infoP">The origins of the château date back to the 10th century. The capture of the château at the end of the 15th century led to the destruction of the fortifications, advanced works and surrounding walls, and the filling in of the cisterns. The château was rebuilt in 1741 by the Count of Ségur, Governor of the Pays de Foix. When the château was used as a prison, a new building was erected against the north tower. Around 1820, restoration and enlargement of the departmental prison.</p>

            <p class="infoP" id="mimi">A palace rises up from the heart of the Sologne marshlands. A dashing young king, François I, has ordered its construction. The château of Chambord is not designed as a permanent residence, and François only stays there for a few weeks. It is a remarkable architectural achievement that the king is proud to show to sovereigns and ambassadors as a symbol of his power engraved in stone. The plan of the castle and its decors stem from a central axis, the renowned double helix staircase, inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, an ascending spiral leading to a profusion of chimneys and sculpted capitals on the terraces.</p>

            <p class="infoP">In 1535, King Francis I incorporated it into the Crown Estate as part of a debt settlement. Later, King Henry II decided to offer it not to the Queen, but to his Favourite, Diane de Poitiers, “in full right of ownership, seisin and possession, completely, peacefully and perpetually, to dispose of as her own and true patrimony.” This artificial exit of Chenonceau from Crown Lands meant that it was saved, two centuries later, from the French Revolution.</p>

            <p class="infoP"><p class="infoP">Located in the Île-de-France region, south-west of Paris, privileged place both of residence and the exercise of power of the French monarchy from Louis XIV to Louis XVI, the Palace and Park of Versailles, built and embellished by several generations of architects, sculptors, painters, ornamentalists and landscape artists, represented for Europe for more than a century, the perfect model of a royal residence. The architectural planning and the majestic composition of the landscape form a close symbiosis, serving as a setting for the magnificence of the interior decorations of the apartments.</p></p>

            <h2 class="castleName"></h2>
            <p class="infoP">The Château de Tours bears witness to the architectural work of the Carolingian era. In 886, Hugues l'Abbé undertook the construction of the first seigniorial residence. At the time, it was largely built of wood.It wasn't until the mid-11th century that a more imposing and resistant stone dwelling appeared. According to excavations carried out by Henri Galinié between 1974 and 1979, this new building came into being thanks to the annexation of Touraine in 1044 by the House of Anjou. At that time, two round towers were built around the château: the Tour de Guise, named after the young duke who escaped from the château in 1591, served as a keep. The second tower was called Tour du Cachot Secret.</p>

            <h2 class="castleName"></h2>
            <p class="infoP"> It was built in the late 15th century by François II - the last Duke of Brittany - and later by his daughter, Anne of Brittany, who was twice Queen of France. This castle is filled with six centuries of history, and a palatial residence with sophisticated façades and Renaissance-era loggias. </p>
